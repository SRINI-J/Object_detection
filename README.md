# Object detection
# object detection models inference scripts

1. Implement loading a custom YOLO-based model and evaluate its performance using dedicated scripts.
2. Explore alternative methods such as SSD, FasterRCNN, and pre-trained models by loading them and examining their respective outputs.

# How to run a scripts

Download the scripts and adhere to the outlined process as specified within the notebook

# Additional Work (Image Contour Detection and Light Predictions)

I have conducted further experimentation to explore image contour detection and light predictions. Please disregard these code snippets as they are not directly related to the main content provided.
